# I-code-this

Welcome to my "I-code-this" repository! This is where I document and share small apps that I've built following challenges from the [I-code-this](https://icodethis.com/app) website.

## <span style="color:red;">Note</span>

-   Some of the apps might not appear correctly or look weird when viewed outside the "I-code-this" website. This is because the code relies on a Tailwind CSS CDN in the HTML, and removing it may affect the styling, padding, and alignment.

Feel free to explore the apps and let me know if you have any suggestions or improvements!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
